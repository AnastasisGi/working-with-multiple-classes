# Mock! - Part 1

## Learning Objectives:

- Define a unit test as 'a test for code isolated from all other code'
- Explain that test doubles can be used to stop objects-under-test from calling other objects in a program
- Refactor a bunch of unisolated unit tests into isolated ones using test doubles

## Overview

* The coach will demonstrate the principles of isolating unit tests.
* You will then repeat the exercise yourself on the same un-isolated unit tests.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository using `git clone <repo url>`.
1. Install any project dependencies using `bundle install`.

> You may have to run `gem install bundler` to install Bundler first.

Your task: isolate the unit tests in `./spec`.
